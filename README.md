# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Overview

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in Python. It is designed not only as a learning tool for those new to the field but also as a reference for experienced developers looking to understand the intricacies of these fundamental concepts.

As an MSc Quantitative Finance major from the University of Glasgow, I am deeply passionate about computational mathematics. This repository is a reflection of my commitment to understanding the core principles of computer science and efficient programming practices.


## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different categories of data structures and algorithms. Each directory contains Python files that implement these concepts, along with test cases to demonstrate their functionality.


## Implemented Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures:
- **Basic Data Structures**
    - Array
    - Hashmap (Dictionary)
- **Advanced Data Structures**
    - **Linked List**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List
    - **Stack**
    - **Queue**
    - **Binary Tree**: Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree
    - **Heap**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap
    - **Graph**: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix
    - **Hash Table**
    - **Trie**
    - **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**
